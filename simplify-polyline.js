	 *	they are unnecessary and we don't need them. In that case we simply return the first and last values (we need these,
	 *	otherwise we can have an array that is the empty set). Part B, if called, recursively calls the RDP method on the 
	 *	half of the array leading to the index and the half after, finding if there are any notable exceptions in them and
	 *	returns a concatenation of the results.
